					<h2>Mercury</h2>
					<p>
						Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun in
						the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97
						Earth days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar
						System. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
						(Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and
						mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the
						Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς).
					</p>
					<p>
						Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit
						as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from
						the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This
						proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen
						near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern
						horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this
						time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is
						often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The
						planet telescopically displays the complete range of
						phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in
						its inner orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its
						synodic period of approximately 116 days.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar
						System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2
						spin–orbit resonance,[16] meaning that relative to the
						fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times
						for every two revolutions it makes around the
						Sun.[a][17] As seen from the Sun, in a frame of
						reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it
						appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years.
						An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day
						every two Mercurian years.

					<h2>Venus</h2>
					<p>
						Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named
						after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
						brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the
						Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare
						occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad
						daylight.[15][16] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and
						so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either
						setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the
						east a little while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun
						every 224.7 Earth days.[17] With a rotation period of
						243 Earth days, it takes longer to rotate about its axis
						than any other planet in the Solar System by far, and
						does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus
						(meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the
						east).[18] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction
						it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the
						Solar System.[19]
					</p>
					<p>
						Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called
						Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size,
						mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is
						radically different from Earth in other respects. It has
						the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets,
						consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The
						atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92
						times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the
						pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus
						has, by far, the hottest surface of any planet in the
						Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C;
						867 °F), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus
						is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective
						clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from
						being seen from space in visible light. It may have had
						water oceans in the past,[20][21] but these would have
						vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway
						greenhouse effect.[22] The water has probably
						photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept
						into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of
						the lack of a planetary magnetic field.[23] Venus'
						surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like
						rocks and is periodically resurfaced by volcanism.

					<h2>Earth</h2>
					<p>
						Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only
						astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29% of
						Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and
						islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly
						by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt water bodies, but
						also by lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which
						together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's
						polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is
						divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate
						across the surface over many millions of years. Earth's
						interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a
						liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field,
						and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.
					</p>
					<p>
						Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and
						oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical
						regions than polar regions, and is redistributed by
						atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases also
						play an important role in regulating the surface
						temperature. A region's climate is not only determined
						by latitude, but also by elevation, and by proximity to
						moderating oceans, among other factors. Extreme weather,
						such as tropical cyclones and heat waves, occurs in most
						areas and has a large impact on life.
